## Directory Comparison Script

This bash script compares files in two directories and checks if the files differ between them. 
It uses `diff` to compare the content of the files in two directories and reports whether files are missing or different.

## Usage

To run the script, provide two directory paths as arguments:

```bash
./CheckFileDifferences.sh /path/to/directory1 /path/to/directory2
```
